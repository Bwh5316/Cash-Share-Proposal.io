# Cash Share
Project Proposal

Description

My proposed idea for this project is to create a money-sharing application, as suggested by one of the examples presented in class on February 20th. The idea is to create a server-based project that when ran, a user will create an account by entering the following:

- First Name

- Last Name

- Date of Birth (DOB)

- Gender

- Username (Created by User) and Password (Created by User)

After an account has been created, the user will login using only their username and password. Once logged in, the following options will be available for the user to utilize the following:

- Profile (Edit Cover Photo, Edit Bio, etc.)

- Send Funds

- Add Friend

- Notifications (e.g. Aaron sent you $20.00)

- Settings (Privacy, Add Bank, Notifications, etc.)

Beyond these operations, I do not know what other options I intend to offer but these are what I am expecting to have but they may be subject to change and be expanded upon over time.



Design

The design for my project will be something of both simplistic and appealing. I want the design to be friendly enough for many different users to easily grasp and navigate while also presenting a unique design. The dashboard, which will act as the homepage, will come after the login portal. The login portal will show the application’s name as the header and two text fields:

- Username (enter username)

- Password (enter password)

Next, there will be a dashboard page where the following options will be available for requests and commands:

- Profile (Edit Cover Photo, Edit Bio, etc.)

- Send Funds

- Add Friend

- Notifications (e.g. Aaron sent you 0.00)

- Settings (Privacy, Add Bank, Notifications, etc.)

I prefer to use MVC vs Spring MVC as I am more comfortable with MVC. If granted permission, I will be using MVC and not Spring MVC; pending upon approval. For the time being, I will be uploading a Spring MVC project as requested by the proposal as a place-holder; it is also empty as I have not starting working on it proactively yet. Also, I plan on using Java FXML as I am fairly familiar with it and I am sure that I can enhance the appearance and capabilities of my project using the language. I believe Java FXML will help me build a nice structure for my user interface. I believe I will need approval to use this language as well, so this may not be a part of my project if denied by the instructor. In relation, I plan on using Java FX’s Scene Builder as I have used it previously and it hands-on for re-positioning buttons and other objects without having to use hard-code. The technologies I intend to use are as follows:

- NetBeans IDE

- Scene Builder

These two technologies are able to be fully integrated as I have used them both before. My main concern is that I will be granted permission to use MVC and not Spring MVC as using Spring MVC while trying to integrate a JavaFX FXML project would bring complications to this idea. With Scene Builder, any work / edits made to a Java FXML project can be exported and then imported into NetBeans. When a JavaFX FXML project has been created in NetBeans, I can choose the Open tab to edit the FXML file with the Scene Builder tool or choose Edit to edit the FXML file with the NetBeans FXML editor. Also, if a user right-clicks the node for the FXML file and chooses Open, then NetBeans will automatically locate the latest installed Scene Builder on the current system and the Scene Builder window will appear on top of the NetBeans window. For more details on the integration of NetBeans and Scene Builder, refer to the following link: https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/scenebuilder/1/use_java_ides/sb-with-nb.html



Schedule

My expectations for each checkpoint, while there will be three checkpoints before the completion of the project, are as follows:

Checkpoint 1: Create Login Portal interface (username and password text fields, submit button, etc.) and construct the layout for the dashboard / homepage. This may also include the full functionality of the buttons with redirection of pages but may be subject to be completed by Checkpoint based upon potential complications.

Checkpoint 2: Create and implement a database to withhold the potential account holder's information, create and test sample users with login authentications and storage in the database.

Checkpoint 3: Ensure that users can create accounts and login effectively (authentication = true), all buttons perform specified actions, give the overall interface a theme (color, consistent fonts, etc.), ensure that each page has its own URL, set up the notifications (e.g alert a account holder that they have been sent funds).

Once I approach the final stages of my proposed project, my final project will look like something like a Venmo or a Cash application (if you are familiar with the two). The design will be of a simpler value but it is too early for me to speculate the major details of the final design.



Justification

My project can be seen as interesting because is creates a major convenience for many people who wish to send their family and friends money without the hassle of traveling to their local bank, Western Union, etc. This will save time and energy for many users.

I don’t think my specific project is necessarily different than any existing applications as there are many money-sharing applications on the market currently, but I plan to differentiate my ideas from the specific components of the current apps on the market. The goal is to make the design, theme, slogan, operations, prompts, and overall project different as possible.

I feel like the overall complexity of my project will create room for me to learn and better understand many different frameworks and topics of programming. I believe I will become comfortable with using server-based programs, databases, Spring MVC (if I am instructed to use it upon approval), HTML, and I will learn how to focus on human-computer interactions. There is definitely a lot of things I think I will learn and become better / more comfortable with!
